# Electric Vehicle Adoption Analysis


## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) in a specific region to provide actionable insights for stakeholders, including policymakers, automakers, and energy providers. The analysis aims to address the following objectives:

1. Understand the distribution of EV adoption across geographic regions.
2. Identify trends in EV types, models, and their electric ranges.
3. Examine eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
4. Provide visualizations to aid in decision-making.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes two primary data sources:

1. **Electric Vehicle Data (Excel)**
   - Contains detailed information about electric vehicles, including geographic, technical, and eligibility data.

2. **Electric Vehicle Population Data (CSV)**
   - Captures key attributes of EVs such as:
     - **Vehicle Details:** Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type (BEV/PHEV), and Electric Range.
     - **Location Data:** County, City, State, Postal Code, Legislative District, and Census Tract.
     - **CAFV Eligibility:** Indicates whether the vehicle qualifies for clean fuel incentives.
     - **Electric Utility Providers:** Information on utility companies serving the vehicles' regions.

### Key Metrics (KPIs) and Visualizations
The following metrics and charts are designed to meet stakeholder requirements:

- **Geographic Distribution:**
  - Visualized using maps to show EV adoption by counties and cities.
  - Identifies areas with the highest density of EVs.

- **Trends Over Time:**
  - Analyzes EV adoption by model year to highlight growth patterns.
  - Differentiates between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

- **Electric Range Analysis:**
  - Compares ranges across vehicle types to identify popular models and evaluate suitability for various use cases.

- **CAFV Eligibility Breakdown:**
  - Assesses the proportion of vehicles eligible for clean fuel incentives.
  - Helps policymakers understand the impact of existing programs.

## Analysis and Findings
1. **Geographic Insights:**
   - Urban areas, such as Seattle, show a higher concentration of EVs compared to rural regions.
   - Legislative districts with robust infrastructure display higher adoption rates.

2. **Vehicle Type Trends:**
   - BEVs outnumber PHEVs in regions with strong charging infrastructure.
   - Popular models like Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Kona dominate due to their superior electric ranges.

3. **CAFV Incentive Analysis:**
   - A significant number of PHEVs do not qualify for CAFV incentives due to limited electric range.
   - Policies targeting improved battery range could incentivize more PHEV adoption.

4. **Electric Range Patterns:**
   - Vehicles with higher ranges (200+ miles) are more prevalent, indicating consumer preference for range reliability.
   

## Conclusion
The analysis provides a clear picture of EV adoption trends, emphasizing the need for:

1. Expanding charging infrastructure to support broader adoption in rural areas.
2. Enhancing CAFV programs to include more PHEV models.
3. Promoting vehicles with higher electric ranges to address consumer range anxiety.

The Power BI dashboard consolidates these insights into a user-friendly interface, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for advancing EV adoption.
